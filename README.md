Worker_BFMS is a java application with Embedded SQlite Database.

When you build an Java application project that has a main class, the IDE
automatically copies all of the JAR
files on the projects classpath to your projects dist/lib folder. The IDE
also adds each of the JAR files to the Class-Path element in the application
JAR files manifest file (MANIFEST.MF).


To distribute this project, zip up the dist folder (including the lib folder)
and distribute the ZIP file(ECDCS.jar), or you can click the link below to download the zip file.

To run the project from the command line, unzip the downloaded zip file, copy and paste it to drive C,
go to the dist folder and type the following:

java -jar "InspectorLogbook.jar"
